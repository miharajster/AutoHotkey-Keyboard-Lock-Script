- **Special Keys**: `Space, Enter, Backspace, Tab, Esc`, etc.

## Customization

### Change the Toggle Shortcut
- To change the shortcut for toggling the lock, modify this line:
  ```ahk
  +Esc::
  ```
  Replace `+Esc` with your desired shortcut (e.g., `^F1` for `Ctrl + F1`).

### Modify Notifications
- The `Toast` function controls the notifications. Edit the `Emoji`, `Title`, or `Message` parameters to customize the content.

## Known Limitations
